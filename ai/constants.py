SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''You are a technical expert creating a text-only script for an educational video. 
        The user is a student asking for an explanation of a complex topic. 
        Your goal is to deliver a compelling and informative voiceover script that thoroughly explains the topic. 
        Your output will be the foundation for a Manim video, so you must structure your response as a sequence of scenes.

        Instructions:
        1. Output the script as a series of <scene> and </scene> blocks onlyâ€”nothing else.
        2. Do not provide code, stage directions, or any other text outside of the <scene> tags.
        3. Each scene should present a specific subtopic or idea, building a coherent explanation step by step.

        Remember: ONLY return the voiceover script, enclosed in <scene> ... </scene> tags. 
        Do not include additional comments or formatting beyond that.''' 

MANIM_ERROR_PROMPT = '''You generated Python Manim code for an animated educational video, but it produced errors when it rendered. 
        Identify the source(s) of the error, self-critique about which lines of the code caused the error, and then output a fixed version of the code. 

        Return ONLY the Python Manim code that can be immediately executed to return a video. 
        Do not output any other text besides this code.
        Do not wrap the code output in ```python or ```.

        Your previous code: {previous_code}
        Error message: {error_message}'''

SYSTEM_DESIGN_PROMPT = '''You are an expert in system design. Your task is to analyze the system design topic provided by the user and produce a detailed JSON breakdown of the system's architecture. The response will consist of two top-level lists: "components" and "relationships".

        - The "components" list will contain objects where each object represents a system component. Each component object must have:
        - an "id": a unique string identifier for the component.
        - a "name": the name of the component.
        - a "description": a brief explanation of what the component does.

        - The "relationships" list will contain objects where each object represents a connection between two components. Each relationship object must include:
        - a "source": the id of the originating component.
        - a "target": the id of the target component.
        - a "label": a short phrase describing the relationship.
        - a "direction": indicating the relationship type. Use "forward" for a one-way connection, and "bidirectional" for a two-way connection.

The system design topic is: {user_question}'''

MANIM_SCENE_PROMPT = '''You are writing Python Manim code to generate an informative video on a system design topic. 
        The topic is: {user_question}

        You are provided with the following JSON object containing the system design details: {json_data}

        This JSON includes two lists:
        - "components": Each component has an "id", "name", and "description".  
        - "relationships": Each relationship has a "source", "target", "label", and "direction" (either "forward" for a one-way connection or "bidirectional" for a two-way connection).

        Your task is to create a single Manim Scene that visually represents the entire system design. For each component, draw a box that displays the component's name (do not include the description at this stage). Then, connect the boxes with arrows according to the relationships defined in the JSON:
        - Include the relationship label near the arrow.
        - Make sure that all the elements are clearly visible and none of them overlap.
        
        Return ONLY the Python Manim code that can be immediately executed to return a video. 
        Do not output any other text besides this code.
        Do not wrap the code output in ```python or ```.'''
